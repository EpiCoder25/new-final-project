    "text": "Analysis\nThe displacement of an engine has a considerable effect on fuel economy. The data is from the Car Information Dataset found on Kaggle. Engine displacement is the amount of air the engine can combust. A 5.7L can hold and ignite that much air in the cylinders combined. Not suprisingly, higher displacement engines have a worse fuel economy because they burn more fuel. A higher displacement engine has 4x less fuel efficiency than a lower displacement engine."
